<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Mohammad Masood,
  but I prefer to go by my middle name, Sufyan.
  I am currently a computer science student 
  who is very interested in programming. I began
  coding only a year ago, but I was not as passionate about it
  as I am now. I chose computer science as my major because
  I heard thats where the money is.</p>

<p>Although I chose this field for the money, I've grown to 
  actually love programming and want to get better. Right now,
  I barely know the basics of Java, C++, and Python. I am also fimiliar with
  C, and the Linux OS.</p>

<p>My goal is to specialize in front-end development for now, mainly because
  back-end makes my head hurt. But, I am extremely willing to learn
  and get better at programming in general, and so I will probably
  end up getting comfortable with back-end programming and become
  a full-stack developer.</p>
